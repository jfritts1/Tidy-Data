# Getting and Clearning Data - Programming Assignment

This course project is for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 

To execute, run the "run_analysis.R" script to produce the following results:


 * Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The results are output into a text file named "tidy_data.txt"
